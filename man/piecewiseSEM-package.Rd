Piecewise structural equation modeling

Fitting and evaluation of piecewise structural equation models, complete
with goodness-of-fit tests, estimates of (standardized) path coefficients,
and evaluation of individual model fits (e.g., through R-squared values).
Compared with traditional variance-covariance based SEM, piecewise SEM
allows for fitting of models to different distributions through GLM and/or
hierarchical/nested random structures through (G)LMER. Supported model
classes include: \code{lm, glm, gls, Sarlm, lme, glmmPQL, lmerMod, merModLmerTest, 
glmerMod, glmmTMB, gam}.

which unites structural equations in a single model, and \code{summary.psem} can
be used on an object of class \code{psem} to provide various summary statistics for 
evaluation and interpretation.
